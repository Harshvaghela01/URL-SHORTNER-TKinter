# URL-SHORTNER-TKinter
Title: URL Shortening Project

Description:
This GitHub repository hosts the codebase for a URL shortening application developed using Python and Tkinter GUI library. The project aims to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface to shorten long URLs into concise, shareable links. The application is built using Python, leveraging the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, making it accessible to users across different platforms.

Key Features:

URL Shortening: Users can input long URLs into the application, and with the click of a button, generate shortened URLs for sharing.

Tkinter GUI: The graphical user interface is developed using Tkinter, providing a native look and feel across various operating systems.

Copy to Clipboard: The application allows users to easily copy the shortened URLs to the clipboard for convenient sharing via other platforms or applications.

Jupyter Notebook Integration: The project includes Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) to provide an interactive environment for users to experiment with the code, understand the functionality, and make modifications if needed.

Code Documentation: The repository includes comprehensive documentation and comments within the code to facilitate understanding and maintenance.

Version Control: The project is managed using Git version control, enabling collaborative development, issue tracking, and codebase management.

Platform Compatibility: The application is designed to be platform-independent, ensuring compatibility with different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

User-Friendly Interface: The GUI is designed to be intuitive, with clear instructions and visual feedback to guide users through the URL shortening process.

Error Handling: The application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected inputs or issues during the URL shortening process.

Dependencies Management: The repository includes requirements.txt or environment.yml files to specify project dependencies, facilitating easy setup and installation for users.

This GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for developers interested in exploring URL shortening techniques and building GUI applications using Tkinter in Python. It provides a well-documented codebase with a user-friendly interface, making URL shortening accessible to a wide range of users.
